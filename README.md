# Trash-Trucker
The IoT-based waste management project aims to revolutionize traditional waste collection methods by leveraging IoT technology.It introduces a smart system that monitors waste bin levels in real-time and optimizes waste collection processes.

#System Components
User Management: Authentication and management of admin and collector accounts.
Waste Bin Management: Registration, updating, and deactivation of waste bins.
Waste Level Monitoring: Integration of sensors for real-time monitoring of waste levels.
Notification System: Sending alerts to collectors and admins based on predefined triggers.
Collection Task Management: Assignment and tracking of waste collection tasks.
Reporting and Analytics: Generation of reports on waste generation trends and collection efficiency.

Traditional waste management relies on manual monitoring and collection methods.
Lack of real-time data leads to inefficiencies, such as overfilled bins and inefficient collection routes.

#Objectives:

Automate waste monitoring and notification processes.
Optimize waste collection routes and schedules.
Improve cleanliness and hygiene in communities.
Provide actionable insights for waste management authorities.
